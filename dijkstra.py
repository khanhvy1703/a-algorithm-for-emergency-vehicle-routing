    """
    Performs Dijkstra's algorithm (uniform cost search) on a 2D grid.
    
    This is the "regular GPS" that searches everywhere equally like ripples in a pond.
    It has no sense of direction - treats all paths as equally promising until it 
    systematically explores everywhere.
    
    Parameters:
        grid: np.ndarray
              2D grid where 0=open cell, 1=blocked cell
        start: tuple  
               (row, col) coordinates for starting position
        goal: tuple
              (row, col) coordinates for goal position  
        return_costs: bool, optional
                     If True, returns cost dictionary (g, h=0, f=g) for each expanded node
        return_expanded: bool, optional
                        If True, returns total number of nodes expanded
        return_visited: bool, optional
                       If True, returns list showing order of node expansion
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (path, [costs], [expanded_count], [visit_order])
               - path: list of (row, col) tuples from start to goal, or None
               - costs: dict mapping (row, col) -> (g, h=0, f=g) if requested
               - expanded_count: int, number of nodes expanded if requested  
               - visit_order: list of expansion order if requested
    
    Algorithm Notes:
        - Uses uniform cost search with no heuristic (h=0 always)
        - Explores nodes in order of actual distance from start
        - Guaranteed optimal path but explores more nodes than A*
        - Search pattern: expands in concentric circles like ripples in pond
    
    Complexity:
        - Time: O(V log V) where V = grid_size¬≤
        - Space: O(V) for priority queue and tracking structures

'''
 DIJKSTRA ALGORITHM SUMMARY

Purpose: Find shortest path in weighted graph with no heuristic guidance

Key Characteristics:
  - Uniform cost search (explores by actual distance only)
  - No direction sense toward goal
  - Guaranteed optimal for non-negative edge weights
  - Explores more nodes than A* but still mathematically optimal

Algorithm Steps:
  1. Initialize priority queue with start node (cost=0)
  2. While queue not empty:
     a. Extract node with lowest actual cost
     b. Mark as expanded
     c. If goal found, reconstruct path and return
     d. For each neighbor:
        - Calculate cost via current node
        - If better than known cost, update and add to queue
  3. Return None if no path exists

Time Complexity: O(V log V + E log V) = O(V log V) for grid graphs
Space Complexity: O(V) where V = number of grid cells

Comparison with A*:
  - Both guarantee optimal paths
  - Dijkstra explores more nodes (ripples outward)
  - A* explores fewer nodes (focused toward goal)
  - Choice depends on heuristic quality and performance requirements

Emergency Vehicle Application:
  - Dijkstra: reliable but explores entire areas
  - A*: faster route calculation = faster emergency response
  - Time savings can be critical in life-threatening situations
