    This is like the "regular GPS" that searches everywhere equally until it finds

        return_costs: bool, optional

        return_expanded: bool, optional
                         If True, returns the total number of unique nodes

                        If True, returns a list representing the exact order 
                        in which nodes were expanded.

    Returns:

            The first returned value is always:
            - path: list of (row, col) tuples representing the optimal path

            Optional returned values based on flags:

                     (if return_costs=True).

SPECIAL NOTES

Dijkstra's Algorithm "Regular GPS" Implementation

Key Characteristics:
- Uses uniform cost search (f = g, h = 0)
- Explores in "ripples" pattern from start
- Guarantees optimal path but explores more nodes than A*
- No heuristic guidance toward goal

Tuple Structure in Priority Queue:
- Format: (f_cost, g_cost, node, path)
- f_cost = g_cost for Dijkstra (since h = 0)
- Consistent ordering prevents runtime errors

Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O(V log V + E log V) = O(NÂ² log N)
  where V = NÂ² cells, E â‰¤ 4V edges
- Space: O(NÂ²) for grid, queue, and path storage

Comparison with A*:
- A* uses f = g + h with Manhattan distance heuristic
- A* typically explores fewer nodes due to directional guidance
- Both guarantee optimal paths in grid environments
